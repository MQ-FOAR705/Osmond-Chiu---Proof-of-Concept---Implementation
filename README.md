# Background:

This repository contains the Proof of Concept Technology Deployment for FOAR705. It will include a software package that can be run that downloads and begins the installation process for Zotero and OpenSemantic Search. The package will also open relevant websites to create accounts, download and provide instructions on how to use those tools and Hypothes.is for data organisation and references.

# Requirements:

This package can only be run on an Apple macOS. It cannot be used on Windows or Linux.

To use these tools on another operating system, a virtual machine or the separate downloading of component tools will be required.

Zotero may be downloaded from https://www.zotero.org/download/

OpenSemantic Search can be downloaded from https://www.opensemanticsearch.org/download/

Virtual Box can be downloaded from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

# Outline:

This package utilises and provides instructions for using three tools for research: Zotero, Hypothes.is and OpenSemantic Search. These tools can be used for the organisation of sources and reference management.

Zotero is an open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials.

Hypothes.is is a web annotation tool that is integrated with browsers

OpenSemantic Search is an open source enterprise-search research tools for faceted search, exploratory search, tagging & annotation, text analytics & mining

Virtual Box is a virtual machine required to run OpenSemantic Search

An executable file was created in Bash that downloaded installation packages for Zotero and OpenSemantic Search, created folders, opened websites to create Zotero and Hypothes.is accounts and prompt the reading of instructions to use the three tools when opened.

The instructions also explain how to connect Zotero to Overleaf and how to integrate Hypothes.is with OpenSemantic Search.
