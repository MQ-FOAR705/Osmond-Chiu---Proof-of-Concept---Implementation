# Background:

This repository contains the Proof of Concept Technology Deployment for FOAR705. It will include a package that can be run that downloads and installs Zotero and OpenSemantic Search. The package will also open relevant websites to create accounts, download and provide instructions on how to use those tools and Hypothes.is for data organisation and references.

# Outline of the Proof of Concept:

This package utilises and provides instructions for using three tools for research: Zotero, Hypothes.is and OpenSemantic Search. These tools can be used for the organisation of sources and reference management.

Zotero is an open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials.

Hypothes.is is a web annotation tool that is integrated with browsers

OpenSemantic Search is an open source enterprise-search research tools for faceted search, exploratory search, tagging & annotation, text analytics & mining

Virtual Box is a virtual machine required to run OpenSemantic Search

Automator was used to create the application that downloaded installation packages for Zotero and OpenSemantic Search, opened websites to create Zotero and Hypothes.is accounts and prompt the reading of instructions to use the three tools when opened.

The instructions also explain how to connect Zotero to Overleaf and how to integrate Hypothes.is with OpenSemantic Search.
