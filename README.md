# Osmond-Chiu---Proof-of-Concept---Implementation

This repository contains the Proof of Concept Technology Deployment for FOAR705. It will include a package that can be run that downloads and installs Zotero and OpenSemantic Search. The package will also open relevant websites to create accounts, download and provide instructions on how to use those tools and Hypothes.is for data organisation and references.
