# Background:

This repository contains the Proof of Concept Technology Deployment for FOAR705. It will include a software package named RBTools for Mac that can be run that downloads and begins the installation process for Zotero and OpenSemantic Search. The package will also open relevant websites to create accounts, download and provide instructions on how to use those tools and Hypothes.is for data organisation and references.

# Outline:

This package utilises and provides instructions for using three tools for research: Zotero, Hypothes.is and OpenSemantic Search. These tools can be used for the organisation of sources and reference management.

Zotero is an open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials.

Hypothes.is is a web annotation tool that is integrated with browsers.

OpenSemantic Search is an open source enterprise-search research tools for faceted search, exploratory search, tagging & annotation, text analytics & mining.

Virtual Box is a virtual machine required to run OpenSemantic Search.

An executable file was created in Bash that downloaded installation packages for Zotero and OpenSemantic Search, created folders, opened websites to create Zotero and Hypothes.is accounts and prompt the reading of instructions to use the three tools when opened.

The instructions also explain how to connect Zotero to Overleaf and how to integrate Hypothes.is with OpenSemantic Search.

# Requirements:

This package can only be run on an Apple macOS. It cannot be used on Windows or Linux. Approximately 4GB of disk space will be required.

To use these tools on another operating system, a virtual machine or the separate downloading of component tools will be required.

Zotero may be downloaded from https://www.zotero.org/download/.

OpenSemantic Search can be downloaded from https://www.opensemanticsearch.org/download/

Virtual Box can be downloaded from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

OpenSemantic Search requires Virtual Box to be installed to operate.

# Installation:

After downloading and opening the zip file, please run the file named RBToolsforMac.

When the software package is run, a folder named install-package will be created on your Desktop where installation files for Zotero, OpenSemantic Search and Virtual Box will be downloaded to.

Your default browser will also open at the URLs to create Zotero and Hypothes.is accounts.

The software's Instructions and a Checklist will also open to guide you through the process of installing and testing the software.

# Issues:

This software package has limitations. It does not provide instructions on how to use the full range of functionalities of OpenSemantic Search or how to link Zotero and Hypothes.is using the Hypothes.is API. For example, thesauruses can be uploaded to automatically tag documents based on keywords. Instructions on these functionalities is not included as I have not been able to work out how to do these in the time available.
